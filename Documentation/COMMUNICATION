TELLSHOUT
-----------
Command Verification then broadcasts to slave

MASTER BOOTUP BROADCAST:  STARTUP: Checks if Slave is active ( EXPECTS: "LIVE" )
MASTER LISTEN BROADCAST:  LISTENING: Expects response for BEHAVIOUR ( EXPECTS: "ALONE" "BE_SELF" "RPS" "MANUAL_ON" )
MASTER RPS BROADCAST:  RPS: Expects response for ROCK PAPER SCISSORS ( EXPECTS: RPS: "ROCK" "PAPER" "SCISSORS" )
MASTER MOVEMENT BROADCAST:  MOVEMENT: Expects response for MOVEMENT ( EXPECTS: "FORWARD" "REVERSE" "LEFT" "RIGHT" "MANUAL_OFF" )

ONDATASENT
-----------
(well not much its just what tellshout is but just without the verification part) ( Literally sendMessage() )
records command into Serial Log

ONDATARECV
-----------
Actual Communicator Between The ESPs

First confirms "LIVE" Message from slave to confirm slave is active (-Response to TELLSHOUT: STARTUP) then allows general
bot activity (STARTUP_CHECK_COMPLETE) then confirms active actions (MOVING or RPSING or LISTENING)

MASTER BOOLEAN:  MOVING: Shifts data received command to Movement_Listen Function Verification (MOVEMENT_COMMAND)
MASTER BOOLEAN:  RPSING: Shifts data received command to RPS_Listen Function Verification (RPS_COMMAND)
MASTER BOOLEAN:  LISTENING: Shifts data received command to Listen Function Verification where MOVING RPSING can be
                            activated through MANUAL_ON or RPS Respectively or Own Behaviours



LISTEN		-- TELLSHOUT: LISTENING
-------
Default Loop Function after STARTUP_CHECK_COMPLETE is true
Performs area scan (unless overridden)
Gets Behaviourial commands from the slave  ( -Response to TELLSHOUT: LISTENING)

MASTER LISTEN_COMMAND ELIMINATION:  VOID: BLANK COMMAND
SLAVE BROADCAST TO MASTER LISTEN_COMMAND:  OVERRIDE: FORCES NEXT COMMAND SENT CANCELLING ALL BEHAVIOUR TEMPORARILY

Responses:
=====================
SLAVE BROADCAST TO MASTER LISTEN_COMMAND:  RPS: Triggers rock paper scissors 
SLAVE BROADCAST TO MASTER LISTEN_COMMAND:  MANUAL_ON: Triggers manual movement commands
SLAVE TELLSHOUT RESPONSE TO MASTER LISTEN_COMMAND:  ALONE: Triggers self behaviour call when recognising no people: Alone()
SLAVE TELLSHOUT RESPONSE TO MASTER LISTEN_COMMAND:  BE_SELF: Triggers self behvaiour call when recognising people: BE_SELF()



RPS_LISTEN 		-- TELLSHOUT: RPS
------------
Triggered by Listen() - RPS

Triggers RPS Verification function with gameplay functions

Responses:
=====================
SLAVE TELLSHOUT RESPONSE TO MASTER RPS_COMMAND:  ROCK
SLAVE TELLSHOUT RESPONSE TO MASTER RPS_COMMAND:  PAPER
SLAVE TELLSHOUT RESPONSE TO MASTER RPS_COMMAND:  SCISSORS



MOVEMENT_LISTEN			-- TELLSHOUT: MOVEMENT
-----------------
Triggered by Listen() - MANUAL_ON

Triggers Movement Verification Function with manual inputs expected. TELLSHOUT: MOVEMENT is only to show when the
master is ready for another movement command

Commands:
============
SLAVE BROADCAST TO MASTER MOVEMENT_COMMAND: FORWARD
SLAVE BROADCAST TO MASTER MOVEMENT_COMMAND: LEFT
SLAVE BROADCAST TO MASTER MOVEMENT_COMMAND: RIGHT
SLAVE BROADCAST TO MASTER MOVEMENT_COMMAND: REVERSE
